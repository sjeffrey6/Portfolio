## Function Tutorial 

#### The picture I used for this project was from a trip I took to the Carolinas!

#### The package 

##### The functions I will be showing today all come from the package lterpalettefinder, which allows for picture and color manipulation. 

The first step is to load the palette finder package. 

```{r Launch package }
library(lterpalettefinder)
```


#### Function #1 : palette_extract

##### The first function I am showing is palette_extract, which lets you extract the colors from a photo. 

*This function has 3 main arguments*

  1. image : this is the name/path to the picture (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, HEIC)
  2. sort : if the extracted hex codes should be sorted by hue and saturation
  3. progress_bar : if you want to 'message' a progress bar

The syntax is 'obj <- palette_extract(image = "file name", sort = FALSE, progress_bar = TRUE)'

```{r Extract color codes from image }
five.points <- palette_extract(image = "595B1357-21E6-458A-A6AB-5C1E52906B0B.png", sort = FALSE, progress_bar = FALSE)
```

#### Function #2 : palette_demo

##### Next, we use the palette_demo function to view the palette that has been extracted. 

*This function has 4 main arguments:* 

  1. palette : the vector of the palette to show the plot of hexadecimal codes 
  2. export : whether you want to export the plot or not 
  3. export_name : if yes to export, the name of the file to create 
  4. export_path : if yes to export, the file path for the exported file

The syntax is 'palette_demo(palette = obj, export = FALSE)'

```{r View color codes in a plot }
palette_demo(palette = five.points, export = FALSE)
```

#### Function #3 : palette_subsample

##### Now that we have the original palette, we can randomly choose any number of colors (1-24) in that palette to create a smaller sample size. 

This is done with the function palette_subsample. 

*This function has 3 main arguments:* 

  1. palette : original palette vector to subsample 
  2. wanted : integer for how many colors to be in the new plot 
  3. random_seed : integer for 'base :: set.seed()' which functions in randomizing the color selection

The syntax is 'obj2 <- palette_subsample(obj, wanted = #, random seed = #)'

```{r Randomly set to choose desired number of color codes }
ten.points <- palette_subsample(five.points, wanted = 10, random_seed = 25)
```

Then we can use palette_demo again to view the smaller sample palette. 

```{r View subsampled plot }
palette_demo(ten.points, export = FALSE)
```
